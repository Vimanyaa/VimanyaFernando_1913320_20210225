# Coconut Oil Sales Quantity Forecast

A leading processed food manufacturer faces significant challenges in inventory management and forecasting due to the high cost of Salesforceâ€™s forecasting extension, leading to reliance on basic manual excel methods. This has caused issues like oversupply and undersupply, affecting financial and operational efficiency. Studies highlight the importance of accurate sales forecasting, with advanced models like machine learning improving accuracy and decision-making.

The project aims to forecast coconut oil sales in Colombo using a time series model with historical sales data from 2021 to 2024 and external factors. Factors such as coconut prices, coconut oil prices and the Consumer Price Index will be considered. 

A SARIMAX and a LSTM model were implemented in Python. Performance will be assessed using MAE, RMSE, and R2. The finalized model (LSTM) was integrated into a Microsoft Power BI dashboard to support production management decisions and provide insights on sales performance by geographic area and product.
