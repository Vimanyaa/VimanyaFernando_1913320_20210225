# Coconut Oil Sales Quantity Forecast

A leading processed food manufacturer faces significant challenges in inventory management and forecasting due to the high cost of Salesforceâ€™s forecasting extension, leading to reliance on basic internal methods. This has caused issues like oversupply and undersupply, affecting financial and operational efficiency. Studies highlight the importance of accurate sales forecasting, with advanced models like machine learning improving accuracy and decision-making.

The project aims to forecast coconut oil sales in Colombo using a time series model with historical sales data from 2021 to 2024 and an external factor. Factors such as weather data, coconut prices, production quantities, inflation rates, and the Consumer Price Index will be considered. The most correlated factor will be included in the final model.

Two models, SARIMA and LSTM, will be used, implemented in Python, and optimized using cross-validation. Performance will be assessed using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. The final model will be integrated into a Microsoft Power BI dashboard to support production management decisions and provide insights on sales performance by geographic area and product.
